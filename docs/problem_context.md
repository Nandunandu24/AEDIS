# Problem Context: Enterprise Email Decision System

## Background
Large enterprises receive a high volume of emails and support tickets daily.
Each incoming message requires a decision before any action can be taken.

## Examples of Incoming Emails
1. "My payment was deducted but service is not activated."
2. "Thank you for resolving the issue."
3. "System is down. Urgent help needed."
4. "Facing issue. Please check."

## Decisions Taken by Humans
- Determine priority (low, medium, high, critical)
- Decide whether to auto-reply or respond manually
- Escalate to specialized teams when required
- Ask for clarification if information is missing
- Close tickets that are already resolved or irrelevant

## Pain Points in Human Decision-Making
- Delays due to high ticket volume
- Inconsistent decisions across agents
- Increased operational cost
- Missed SLAs for critical issues
- Human fatigue leading to errors

## Core Problem
Human decision-making does not scale reliably with volume and complexity.
A consistent, context-aware, autonomous decision system is required.
